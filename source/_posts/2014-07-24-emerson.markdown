##Always do what you are afraid to do.

I see the bright green grass and silvery moon tower over Big Stacy Park and I fall into a simple dream. A dream that each life on this planet could grow and stretch itself upward to stars. That a cool brisk wind could rush past the face of no one so hard hearted that their only answer to the universe is "no". That the canyons in the earth did not seem quite small in comparison to the divisions in humankind.

I write Ruby code. I write songs, poems, dreams.

I look through windows, walk down streets.

Coffee being ground, the smell of the earth.

I look to the universe with my quiet "yes".

Peace. A good day.
