StarDate: Genius o'clock. But seriously, I had a fun time tuning into the RailsConf 2014 livestream of DHH's talk. It was actually really encouraging to someone who has only been really digging into programming for about a year. One of the biggest take-aways for me was that code should be clear, intuitive, and fun to write. The main idea seemed to be "don't let writing tests ruin your architecture, style, and clarity".

Hopefully this blog becomes less blah balh balh and more like Star Trek: NextGen fairly soon.
