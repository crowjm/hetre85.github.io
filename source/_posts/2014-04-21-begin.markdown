This is incredible first post. Right now I am working on some Rails projects that I am really excited about getting deployed. The main reason I wanted to start this Octopress blog was to reflect on what I have learned in the last year that I have been learning Ruby/Rails/etc.

I'll be trying to do rather granular blog posts that outline one or two things I learn each day.
