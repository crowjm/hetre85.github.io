### Learning is good

So, I have been working primarily in Ruby for over a year and have absolutely loved it.
I have super enjoyed the time I have spent in JavaScript as well.
There's something magical about JavaScript that I can't quite put my finger on.

I wanted to pick up a new language; something fun and different.

Something that the mustache twirling, penny-farthing riding hipsters of devland wouldn't look at and flick the ashes of their cigarettes on.

I decided to learn Erlang. And it is **so much fun**.

I will of course post more about this in the future.
