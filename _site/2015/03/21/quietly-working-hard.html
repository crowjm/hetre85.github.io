<p>What does it mean to quietly work hard at something and why do I love this idea so much? We’ll take a look at the different components of the philosophy and practice of this idea.  Hopefully by the end of this post you’ll be inspired to do something similar or at least find your own method that keeps you inspired. We’ll start by looking at why it matters to be quiet, at least sometimes.</p>

<h3 id="working-quietly">Working Quietly</h3>
<p>Working quietly means that you have already realized that you want to do something and if you haven’t already taken the first step then you are going to take it right now. Seriously if there is something awesome that you are putting off, please stop reading this post, close all your buzzfeed tabs, and go do it. It doesn’t matter if it’s learning to paint, volunteering somewhere, working out, or anything else new and challenging you have decided to do. Don’t tweet about it. Don’t call your friends first. Quietly go get started.</p>

<p>Working quietly means there are a few trusted people that know about your new project. Otherwise you would be working silently, which is not the goal. I find that having one mentor and a couple of encouragers surrounding me at the beginning is the best setup. Avoid telling everyone you know about your new project, because this tends to give your brain the reward feeling of actually having done something (which would be false this early on).</p>

<p>The early stages of a new project don’t really require any critics, at least not in my opinion. Any early criticism should come directly from your mentor. Right now you need to make the activation energy that you’ve mustered up last long enough to bring the concept into reality. Bring the third party critics in somewhere after your project is at least a little off the ground so they don’t crush your spirit but they still have time to give honest criticism that can improve your project. Early on you just need to survive.</p>

<h3 id="working-hard">Working Hard</h3>
<p>Working hard is going to mean that you have to carve out new time in your day to achieve this new goal. For me, this is all about the early morning. When I am working on something new I tend to wake up early and let my rested, fresh mind handle the learning curves of the new challenge.</p>

<p>I know some people are night owls, and that is fine. I would warn you though, if you have a full time job your body/brain is going to be pretty taxed just from the day’s work. You may find it hard to actually start working on your project.</p>

<p>The mornings work so well for me (I’m talking like 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning) because you have this incredible feeling that you really got the jump on the day. It only takes me about a week of getting up that early before my body adjusts and it’s not too difficult.</p>

<p>If you are really serious about developing a new skill or getting a new project going, I can’t recommend early mornings enough. To me it’s like a latent special power that we all have but that few of us ever activate.</p>

<h3 id="staying-the-course">Staying the Course</h3>
<p>It’s all to easy to give your new project one or two days of hard work and then give up. A lot times we say something like “oh you know life just happens.” And that’s totally fine if life is going crazy for you right now, it may not be the best time to try to stick with this. But, if you’re like me, a lot of times that’s an excuse that amounts to little more than “I totally forgot to set my alarm” or “I’m going to allow myself to prioritize something less important over my new project because it sounds more fun.” I think that’s where most of us fall short of doing something new. Going out with friends is fine, but why did I stay out till 2am on Friday night if I knew I was planning on working on my project Saturday morning? Try to pinpoint these issues ahead of time and make a decision about your priorities. It will really shed light on how badly you want to make it work.</p>

<p>Staying the course is easier for me the older I get. But you’re never too young to do simple planning tricks like making your to-do list a day ahead of time (or making one at all), choosing not to procrastinate, giving yourself deadlines, or joining a community of people who are trying to achieve similar results.</p>

<h3 id="tying-it-all-together">Tying it all Together</h3>
<p>What change do you want to make in life? What new skill do you want to develop? What project are you getting really excited about?</p>

<p>These are great starting points, but fair warning: quietly working hard on something is really tough, and many will probably give it about a week. But whatever you do, if you choose to really dig in, I’m sure you can find the beauty and joy in it that will maintain your interest. And if you do fall away after a week, don’t be too proud to jump back in to it. When I started learning programming I hit a wall about 3 months in and didn’t touch it for maybe two weeks. All it took was a brief chat with a mentor to get me back on track and give me the power to visualize overcoming my obstacles.</p>

<p>Dream huge and work hard. I know you can do it.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
