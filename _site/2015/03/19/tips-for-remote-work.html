<p>I never thought I’d be <em>remotely</em> qualified to give any advice on remote work. And, hey, don’t get me wrong - I’m not some sort of remote work genius that you can schedule an appointment with to solve all of your issues. That said, I do have 6+ months experience of working full time as a remote developer. In this time, I have learned a little bit about remote work, and a lot about myself. So, here it is, a short blog post about some pitfalls that I had to discover on my own that might help you out if you are new to remote work.</p>

<h4 id="get-everything-in-writing">1. Get Everything in Writing</h4>
<p>No matter who you answer to, whenever you get an assignment please get it in writing. There is nothing more frustrating for you and your employer than you spending a whole day working on the wrong thing because there was a verbal miscommunication.</p>

<p>I learned this the hard way finding out that even if I took really great notes during conversations that something usually got missed. My favorite way to avoid this is to have some system like Github (create an issue, you get assigned to it) or Trello where everyone knows what everyone else is working on and all the requirements are in writing. If you have an employer or project manager who isn’t technical help them set up an account and show them how to add issues and just the very basics so that you have a streamlined, central source of communication around your project. I much prefer one of these systems over emails because a.) we get way too many emails already and b.) managing email threads… is that really how you want to spend your day?</p>

<h4 id="overcommunicate">2. Overcommunicate</h4>
<p>If you jump on a quick phone or video call with a colleague or your project manager and they ask you to get something done, no matter how simple it is I say something like this: “Before we get off this call I want to make sure that I understand you correctly. You want me to set variable x equal to false?” Then ask them to create an item in whatever project management system you use. Good policy to have: if it warrants a call, it should probably be written down.</p>

<h4 id="breaks">3. Breaks</h4>
<p>If you’ve ever worked in an office you know that it’s basically the hit factory of people taking breaks. I think that one of the hardest parts of being remote is that because you don’t have any “I’m in the office” visibility, it’s really easy to try to overcompensate by not taking any breaks. I used to really worry about taking a lunch break. I remember thinking, “someone’s gonna email me and I won’t be there to respond and then the server will blow up and then a ultra negative doom spiral will flush the earth down the cosmic toilet.”</p>

<p>As it turns out, none of that happens when you take a lunch break, and even if it did, you not taking a lunch break won’t stop it. I admit, I do check my email during my lunch break to make sure that no one is waiting on anything from me, but I’ve come a long way from the “I’ll just eat in front of my computer and work every day” philosophy.</p>

<p>When I used to work for Apple, we would take one 15 minute break in the mid-morning, an hour lunch, and another 15 in the afternoon. This is a pretty great setup but can be really tough for developers since I know a lot of us kind of get in the zone for 3 or 4 hours at a time and in all honesty a 1 hour lunch is a little long to me. Either way, the next time you push a bunch of commits up ask yourself when your last break was, because chances are it’s 4pm and you haven’t had lunch yet.</p>

<h4 id="stop-checking-your-work-email-even-for-just-2-seconds">4. Stop Checking Your Work Email, Even for Just 2 Seconds</h4>
<p>Nothing is worse than the humanoid that won’t stop checking their work email when they’re at a family gathering, a friends night out, or worst of all… a date. Imagine you and your friends are out hiking on a Saturday, you stop to rest and decide to check your work email. Why? Seriously, why? “Sorry peeps, I have to go respond to this really not urgent issue. Later” Are you going to say that?</p>

<p>That’s a terrible setup. Check your email during your normal work hours and then just have a way to be reached if there’s an urgent issue. I like for there to be one person that I trust who I’m cool with shooting me a text or calling me if there’s something that needs immediate attention.</p>

<p>Bottom line, you <em>have</em> to be able to leave work at work - <em>at least</em> sometimes. Otherwise you will start to notice some bad side effects in your life including but not limited to: loss of friends, chronic fatigue, anxiety, etc. And let’s be real. If, as a developer, you cannot be unavailable for at least a major part of the weekend and a reasonable part of weeknights you will probably burn out.</p>

<h4 id="maintain-visibility">5. Maintain Visibility</h4>
<p>For me, this is the cure to a lot of remote ailments, and <em>please be in video conferences if you are remote</em>. If you have video conferences that are scheduled, do not bail on these. It’s one thing for local employees to miss a meeting every once in a while; they’re going to be seen in the office later that day. But if a remote employee misses it, that might be the only time that week (or month!) that certain team members will see you. I make a point to absolutely clear my schedule for any meetings for one simple reason: it’s my opportunity to connect with the team in a more human way. A video conference might not be much but it’s a heck of a lot more than just being a gravatar to someone else.</p>

<h4 id="know-your-best-traits-and-bring-them">6. Know Your Best Traits and Bring Them</h4>
<p>What personal traits do you bring to the table just as a human on this earth?</p>

<p>If you don’t know, find out. And do everything you can to make sure it comes across even in your remote work.</p>

<p>I’ll give you one example. Many of my favorite people are encouragers. You know them, the people that you are always excited to see because you know they will take interest in your life, your work, and will probably give you a word of encouragement before you part ways. They leave you energized.</p>

<p>Imagine how lost this trait could for people who are remote. All you ever see is their commits, or maybe a cameo in a video conference.</p>

<p>But all it takes to bring that trait to the table is a little bit of effort. If you’re an encourager, make sure to send an email to someone who just finished up a big project and let them know what you like about it. Next time there is a conference call take a moment to give a shoutout to a colleague who did something to save you a lot of time, or whatever. Above all, be geniune. Be earnest.</p>

<p>And maybe what you bring to the table is something totally different, but I guess all I’m saying is don’t let that be lost just because you aren’t in the office. Don’t be just a gravatar to people on your team. Share your personality and your sense of wonder about the world.</p>

<h4 id="reach-out">7. Reach Out</h4>
<p>Developers love to learn new things and solve problems. I think this is a great quality that leads to innovation, creative solutions, and better company/product/whatever. This leads us to want to figure things out on our own, and we’ll usually give something an honest effort before bothering another developer about what something in the code base does.</p>

<p>In a group setting it’s just easier to realize that you’ve been trying to figure something out for too long and you just need to ask someone else to look at it with you. But with remote work  you really lose that sense of “maybe I just need to ask someone what this confusing code is doing.”</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor. Set a time limit for how long you should give anything that’s got you stumped before reaching out. You’d be surprised at how easy it is to spend an hour on something that a two or three minute chat could easily explain. Better to bother someone with a question upfront than have to explain later that it took you a super long time to figure it out by yourself.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Well, so much for this being short.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long I will work remote. I’m sure there are developers who have been doing it for many years and still love it. At six months in I am still having a lot of fun with it and it’s an incredible break from the last 10 years of “going to work” and “interacting with humans.” Also, in Austin I’m saving almost 2 hours of my day compared to my previous situation just because of commute times (the traffic here is the worst).</p>

<p>I still have a lot to learn about remote work. And, yes, I realize that there are many different remote scenarios. A lot of people work in co-working spaces, coffee shops, home offices, et al. I like to mix it up but do the majority of my work from my home office (the coffee is cheaper).</p>

<p>Hope this helps anyone who comes across it.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
