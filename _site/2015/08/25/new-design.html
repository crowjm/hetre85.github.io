<p>Hi. Chances are you have never been to this blog, but not long ago, it was a plain, out of the box, jekyll blog. It looked pretty gnarly, like a 90’s website had a dream about the future. Like a geocity rising from the ashes of an angelfire.</p>

<p>When all seemed lost, yea, when even the sun itself began to set on the hope of this blog along came Jesse. She is a recent graduate of the Iron Yard’s UI Design program, as well as javascripter. You can read more about her process and her really cool “100 Days Project” as well as her blog over at <a href="http://www.jessecrow.com">jessecrow.com</a>.</p>

<p>When I get a chance to work with someone who really cares about what they’re doing it inspires me. I know that this is a small, new blog but that didn’t stop Jesse from fully engaging in her design process. We talked through concepts and influences, then she would build really nice style tiles for different cohesive ideas. It was like getting to see a preview of the design vibe. </p>

<p>After Jesse iterated over some concepts and style tiles, she produced mock-ups for several different viewport widths, and then we actually coded it up together. She did most of the driving as she is a jekyll/sass master.  The big take away from our pair programming session for me was that while sass is not difficult to learn, it takes a lot of skill and experience to organize your assets and stylesheets in a way that is extensible now and easy to change in the future. Sitting down for a few hours with a really skilled UI designer absolutely changed how I think about structuring style and content. It was also refreshing to work on something that’s not a rails app for a change :)</p>

<p>We went back and forth a bit about whether or not to use a mixin for a grid. In the end, the mixin was just more than we needed for the purposes of this blog and we decided against it. One thing I’ve been thinking about lately is going with the simplest solution that works now instead of engineering for situations that do not yet exist. I will take whatever modicum of simplicity I can get in the world of stylesheets.</p>

<p>If you are working on a project with someone who has a high level of skill, do yourself a favor and ask if you can participate in the process at some point. I’m so glad that I got to help set up the jekyll stuff, learn more about sass, and watch a great designer at work.</p>

<p>I will be blogging about something new that I’m working on starting tomorrow. I think it will be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
