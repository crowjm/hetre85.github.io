###Changing the framework and layout
I was using Octopress to blog. It was cool being able to install themes and have so some neat command line stuff, but for me it was just too big. I like the idea of a plain jekyll blog.
My first goal is to change the style. My second goal is to see if I can stick to blogging for one week. If I am able to stick with it then I will put in some time next weekend to make additional changes to the style and layout.
We'll see how it goes!
